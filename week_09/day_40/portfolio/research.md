Surveillance is an issue...will never surveil other user's to see what they've read and reviewed.  Nor does she care to post something about the books she's read that she could have real life conversations about.
Categorizing, and organizing, books is a job, not fun.
Stats are like an unwanted nanny wagging her finger saying that she's only read this much and needs to read more
Rating something like a book is too fluid to do.  Five stars isn't enough for her to do this.

Might use it if it was a true reflection of what she's read

Record's of the books you've read is awesome!
Great for her personally to look at the books she's read
Don't have many friends in real life that she could call up and discuss books with
Cool to see her progress

####*Dislikes*
Bought by Amazon
5000 friend limit...silly
Cover battles, some books will not keep the right color
No proper way to document a reread of a book
You can't embed video's as a normal user.....silly. No time to review a books  
####*Likes*
Easy way to keep track of every book she owns
Shelves.  If anyone needs to see what to buy her, they can just go to her wishlist shelf and buy.
Follow all her friends, and get loads of recommendations from them as well as get suggestions from the friends she follows
Stats, go into 50 book challenge to see what time periods you like most and see what periods you can read from more

####*Dislikes*
Horrible rating system.  Ability to rate before a book is produced, and his unrated book is better than the grapes of wrath, ulysses, and the great gatsby  
####*Likes*
He still likes it, just wants changes.

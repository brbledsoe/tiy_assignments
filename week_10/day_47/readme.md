###_What_

For the City Network is a non-profit organization that looks to make volunteering an easier and more comprehensible task for those who want to volunteer around the Austin area.  They also look to connect similar non-profit's and organization's, a network that is ever-growing, so that making Austin a better place can become a more communally shared effort.

###_Possible Problems_

##Game Plan (Stay Design Centered)
####Pages: Home + Connect + Connect-Results + Give + Give-Result

* Navigation: Position the nav on top of the page rather than on the side, and make it indicate what page the user is currently on.  

* Tasks: Clarify the path for the two users (volunteers and organizations) of this site.  For instance Connecting for volunteer's isn't that clear from the home page.  Instructions or more explanations about tasks might help. 

*Filters:  Want to change the layout of the filter's on the connect page to have equal hierarchy. Also want to make changing the filter something that is also available on the Connect-Result's page. 

* Grid: Decrease the white space, and utilize the extra room for making clearer distinctions and indications for what this site is about.  I may add some info graphic's about current issue's in Austin, and how one person can really make an impact. 

* Hierarchy:  Make the font size, and capitalizations,
